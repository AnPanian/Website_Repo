                    <p>
                        In the personal website project I was able to explore my own design tools. Instead of taking a plan that was given to me I had to generate my own.
                        I worked through the process of finding and altering great images to load quickly and be eye catching. I did research on mixing font styles and worked
                        through trials and errors of getting items to line up without the measurements given to me via a plan.

                <p>
                    I greatly enjoyed working on this project. For this assignment Skillcrush supplied me with a built design so I could work on getting exactly what I need via 
                    photoshop. I used the photoshop image to pull my images, fonts, and measurements from. It was an oppertunity to practice a simple layout with just a touch of 
                    fun to draw the client in but keep the site simple and clean.

                    <p>
                        I am originally from Portland, Or. I believe that's where I get my edgier design ideas from. Portland is full of diverse cultures and amazing street art.
                        After my husband joined the military, we had the oppertunity to travel throughout the west part of the U.S. We've had the privilege to live in Tucson, Az,
                        Pocatello, Id, and are now settling into Colorado Springs, Co. When I'm not gaming or reading indoors on cold wintery days, we enjoy hiking, and exploring our
                        new homes towns.
